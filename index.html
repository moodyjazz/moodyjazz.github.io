                <p>Sorry, the code is a little atrocious, but you'll get used to it. Working on it. Anyway, this is the first mini crossword I ever made. There are some nods to things I enjoy, like BOBA. I thought BENTO and ROES kind of worked well together, like for a sushi bento vibe. ON AIR is a direct reference to my time as a music DJ. AW GEE gives Rick and Morty vibes. BAM is almost like BAMM, which was the acronym for the college dorm complex I RA'd at.</p>

                <p>I have many allergies, including fruits, notably stone fruits. I love PEACHes... too bad I can't eat them. For anyone wondering why my gamer tag is usually "minheepeaches", this is the lore.</p>

                <summary>min's notes</summary>
                <p>I thought it was sort of clever to have a sequence of vowels. You could argue that "y" should have been in there, but that would've made my life much harder.</p>

                <summary>min's notes</summary>
                <p>This is one where the shape (aka the filled in black squares) really dictated the theme. I was already thinking about Nov 5 and all related feelings... so just wanted to communicate the importance of voting in my own small way.</p>

                <summary>min's notes</summary>
                <p>At this point is when I felt truly like a crossword maker. I was thinking about how "water sign" could mean RAIN but also SCORPIO, my star sign, and so on. Aha! Too bad SCORPIO, CANCER, and PISCES are all too long (letter-wise) for a mini, so I settled for "fire signs". Please pause for a moment of triumph.</p>

                <p>Another one where I tried to be all matchy matchy. I thought having a CRISS and CROSS in a crisscross shape, and then SIN and AISLE made for a nice, churchly puzzle. Idk, I felt really smart.</p>

                <summary>min's notes</summary>
                <p>The brainchild of a Brooklyn-Botanic-Gardened-out pair of friends, aka [7-Across] and me. We decided to co-create a puzzle that was all about [7-Across], and it made for a very awesome (and unusually French) theme. The first co-constructed puzzle on this site! Maybe I should add a message box so people can submit potential themes, ideas, or words! For now, j text me or email me at minhee.han17@gmail.com.</p>

                <summary>min's notes</summary>
                <p>A fun one inspired by Oxford's WOTY. Similar to the Pantone Color of the Year, I don't think these X of the Year things are scientifically backed up or anything, but rather a reflection of the times according to a small group of semi-qualified people. Whatever. Still fun. This puzzle was inspired by the everchanging language of Gen Z, though I'd argue there is a culture difference between Old Gen Z (e.g. me at 26) and Young Gen Z (e.g. my brother at 21). Am I using e.g. right? Someone tell me.</p>
